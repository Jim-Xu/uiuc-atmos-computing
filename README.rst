ATMS Computing Documentation
=======================================

This GitHub repository contains documentation for computing
within the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Illinois.

The latest version of documentation may be viewed at https://computing-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Steps for producing documentation locally
-----------------------------------------

For contribution/testing purposes, the documentation may be compiled locally by changing into
the ``docs`` directory by:

``cd docs``

And the HTML code can then be produced by:

``make html``

with the result being viewable by accessing ``build/html/index.html``.
